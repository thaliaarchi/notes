# Unexpectedly Turing-complete

This is a collection of systems, such as restricted subsets of programming
languages or games, that are Turing-complete, but may not be expected. I have
included programs that prove Turing-completeness by construction, but also other
interesting programs for fun and demonstration.

## Subsets of programming languages

- C variable-length arrays: A subset of C99, “disembodied C”, with only VLA
  length expressions and functions with empty bodies, parameters, and forward
  declarations.
  - [MD5, SHA-256, and Conway’s Game of Life](https://lemon.rip/w/c99-vla-tricks/)
    by lemon (2022)
- C++ templates: A subset of C++ with only templates, template specialization,
  `struct`, `typename`, and `typedef`.
  - [“Impact of Economics on Compiler Optimization”](https://sci-hub.se/10.1145/376656.376751)
    by Arch D. Robison (2001), in section 4, frames C++ templates as a
    compile-time optimization in, provides a tree sum example, and compares it
    to functional programming:

    > Template metaprograms are programs that run at compilation time. When the
    > ISO C++ committee added templates to C++, the following features were
    > required:
    > - Instantiation of member types (and member constants of integral type) is
    >   demand driven.
    > - Template identifiers may be overloaded, with resolution based on pattern
    >   matching.
    > - Templates may be recursive.
    >
    > The list above makes obvious to functional programmers what the committee
    > did not realize until later: templates are a functional language,
    > evaluated at compilation time.

  not—the opposite of typical.
