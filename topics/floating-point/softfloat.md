# Software floating point libraries

## Berkeley SoftFloat

[Berkeley SoftFloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html) by John
Hauser is a C library, that implements IEEE-754. The source is primarily
distributed as archives and is seemingly maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/ucb-bar/berkeley-softfloat-3).

[Berkeley TestFloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/TestFloat.html) tests
IEEE-compliance. [Berkeley HardFloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/HardFloat.html)
provides Verilog implementations.

Bindings and libraries:
- [softfloat-wrapper](https://github.com/dalance/softfloat-wrapper) for Rust
  provides a high-level API using softfloat-sys.
  [[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/softfloat-wrapper)]
- [softfloat-sys](https://salsa.debian.org/Kazan-team/softfloat-sys) for Rust
  provides FFI.
  [[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/softfloat-sys)]
  It looks to be verified with [softfloat-verify](https://salsa.debian.org/Kazan-team/softfloat-verify).
  A fork is maintained at [tacanslabs/softfloat-sys](https://github.com/tacanslabs/softfloat-sys).
- [chipshort/softfloat-c](https://github.com/chipshort/softfloat-c) is an
  automatic conversion of SoftFloat to Rust.
- [softfloat-hs](https://github.com/GaloisInc/softfloat-hs) for Haskell.
- [wangkui0508/float128](https://github.com/wangkui0508/float128) for Go.

Forks:
- [SDL-Hercules-390/SoftFloat](https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/SoftFloat)
  for Hercules has more recent maintenance, but it seems to not be for
  general-purpose use.
- [tacanslabs/berkeley-softfloat-3](https://github.com/tacanslabs/berkeley-softfloat-3)
  adds Wasm build support.

## LLVM `APFloat`

`llvm::APFloat` is a C++ data type in LLVM, that implements arbitrary-precision
floats with various semantics. The sources are at
[`llvm/include/llvm/ADT/APFloat.h`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/APFloat.h),
[`llvm/unittests/ADT/APFloatTest.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/unittests/ADT/APFloatTest.cpp),
and [`llvm/lib/Support/APFloat.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/lib/Support/APFloat.cpp).

[`rustc_apfloat`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_apfloat) is a port of it to
Rust, used in rustc and [Cranelift](https://github.com/CraneStation/rustc_apfloat).

[`ieee-apsqrt`](https://github.com/SolraBizna/ieee-apsqrt) extends
`rustc_apfloat` with square root.

## GNU MPFR

[GNU MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/) is a C library for floating-point computations
with arbitrary precision, which is set on construction.

Rug for Rust wraps MPFR with [`Float`](https://docs.rs/rug/latest/rug/struct.Float.html).

## libm

libm is a C math library for machines that support IEEE-754 binary64. Is has
several implementations.

- [musl math](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/math) is the libm for
  musl-libc
- [fdlibm](https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/) (Freely Distributable LIBM)
- [FreeMiNT FDlibm](https://github.com/freemint/fdlibm) forked from fdlibm in
  2008 and has since been maintained and expanded.
- [OpenLibm](https://openlibm.org/) was built for Julia, and works consistently
  across compilers and operating systems and in 32- and 64-bit environments.
- [FreeBSD msun](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/tree/master/lib/msun) is
  FreeBSD's math library
- CRlibm (correctly-rounded mathematical library)
  - [CRlibm.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/CRlibm.jl) wraps it for Julia
    and says that CRlibm is state-of-the-art

## Go

Go uses a [softfloat](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/softfloat64.go)
implementation by default for ARMv5, and it can be enabled for
MIPS (since [Go 1.10](https://go.dev/doc/go1.10#ports) [[issue](https://go.dev/issues/18162)]),
386 (since [Go 1.16](https://go.dev/doc/go1.16#386) [[issue](https://go.dev/issues/40255)]),
and ARM (since [Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22#arm) [[issue](https://go.dev/issues/61588)]).

## simple-soft-float

[simple-soft-float](https://salsa.debian.org/Kazan-team/simple-soft-float) is
a straightforward reference implementation of IEEE-754 in Rust. It looks to be a
great reference and has excellent tests.
[[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/simple-soft-float)]
