# The biggest jq programs in the world

Inspired by Oils' [“The Biggest Shell Programs in the World”](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World),
I want to create something similar for jq like what I've done with the
[Whitespace Corpus](https://github.com/wspace/corpus) and
[Brainfuck Program Corpus](https://github.com/thaliaarchi/bfcorpus).
[Awesome jq](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-jq) has some programs (not
included here), but does not focus on them.

The following is the result of a quick survey of the GitHub
profiles of all contributors to jq with at least 10 commits, searching their
repos for “jq” in the repo description and filtering to jq-language repos. The
numbers are line counts.
