# RVSDG

Uses state edges.

Ports are structural! That's why it would work with e-graphs! That is, you can
consider a sub-graph on its own and the ports are just opaque. Input ports seem
like BB params.

This reminds me of my approach since Nebula of modeling an abstract stack for
Whitespace or abstract memory for Brainfuck. (A better name could be stack view
or memory view.)
